# Penguin Animation Project

## Overview
This project presents an interactive 3D model of a penguin created using basic geometric shapes (cubes and triangles) rendered via WebGL. Users can manipulate the penguin's wings and legs, control camera angles, and activate animations through a web interface.

## Features
- **3D Penguin Model:** Constructed from cubes and triangles for the body, wings, and legs.
- **Interactive Controls:**
  - **Camera Angles:** Adjust the X and Y angles of the camera using sliders or by dragging the mouse across the canvas.
  - **Wing and Leg Manipulation:** Use sliders to dynamically adjust the angles of the penguinâ€™s wings and legs.
  - **Animation Controls:** Toggle animations on and off with button controls, affecting wing and leg movements.
- **Special Animation:** Holding down the shift key activates a special jump animation, where the penguin performs a jumping and swaying motion.
